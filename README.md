# Chemical-Tadpole

Chemical Tadpole is a coupled model of soil chemical weathering and landscape evolution. This is the model used to perform the simulations in:

Ferrier K.L., Perron J.T., in review.  The importance of hillslope scale in responses of chemical erosion rate to changes in tectonics and climate.  Journal of Geophysical Research - Earth Surface.

The code is based on the Tadpole landscape evolution model available at
